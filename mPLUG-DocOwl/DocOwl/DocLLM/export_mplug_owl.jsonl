{"image": "images/document_8.png", "question": "Why the tar sands are the most logical source of supplemental supply?", "answer": "The tar sands are the most logical source of supplemental supply because they are abundant, accessible, and relatively easy to extract compared to other sources of oil. Tar sands are found in large deposits in Canada, which makes them a readily available resource. Additionally, the extraction process for tar sands is relatively straightforward, as it involves mining the deposits and then using steam or hot water to loosen the bitumen, which is the viscous, sticky substance that makes up the tar sands. This process is less complex than other methods of oil extraction, such as offshore drilling or fracking, which can be more costly and time-consuming. As a result, the tar sands are a viable option for supplementing the world's oil supply, especially in the context of the current global energy crisis."}
